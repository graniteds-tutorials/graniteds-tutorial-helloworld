== The JavaFX client application

The client application is a simple JavaFX form which will remotely call the Hello World service.
It's a single main class which consists in 4 parts:

. Bootstrap the GraniteDS container and configure the client components
. Define the JavaFX UI
. Execute the remote call in a UI handler
. Handle the closing of the application

Here is the source code for the first bootstrap/configuration part:

<1> Bootstrap the GraniteDS Tide context. Note that we pass a +JavaFXApplication+ to indicate that we need JavaFX support and pass the actual JavaFX application object and stage.
<2> Configure a +ServerSession+ object in the context, which represents a user session with a remote server.
<3> Configure a client proxy for the service, the name +helloWorldService+ on the client should match the name on the server
(see <<server.destination,here>> where the service name is defined in the server application).
<4> Start the server session, initializing all required resources.

The UI is a simple JavaFX form and there is absolutely no dependency or specific requirement to have it work with GraniteDS:

The interesting part is how to bind the button click and enter key with a call to the remote service:

include::{srcdir}/main/java/org/graniteds/tutorial/remoting/client/HelloWorldClient.java[tags=client-call]
----
<1> We call the remote method +hello+ on the client proxy, passing the user input +nameField.getText()+ as argument
<2> The last argument is a responder class implementing +TideResponder+ which will handle the asynchronous result
<3> The success result handler updates the UI label with the +event.getResult()+ containing the object returned by the service method
<4> The fault handler logs the error information from +event.getFault()+ in case of a fault

Finally we set a close handler on the window to properly release all resources:

Finally, here are the maven dependencies for the JavaFX module:
