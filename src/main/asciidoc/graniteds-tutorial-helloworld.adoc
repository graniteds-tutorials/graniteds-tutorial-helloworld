= GraniteDS Remoting Tutorial

This tutorial shows how to build a simple client/server Hello World application where the client and server communicate
using GraniteDS remoting.

If you are looking at this document in html format, you have likely already built the project.

In any other case, you can build it with:

[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
mvn clean install -Dserver={server} -Dclient={client}

mvn asciidoctor:process-asciidoc -Dserver={server} -Dclient={client}
----

You can open the project in your preferred IDE to browse the source code conveniently.
Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA project files are provided, other IDEs such as NetBeans are usually able to directly import Maven projects.

NOTE: The provided Eclipse project files require the M2E plugin to manage Maven dependencies.

ifeval::["{client}" == "flex"]
NOTE: Using Flash Builder is recommended if you want to import the Flex module in Eclipse.

NOTE: The compilation in Flash Builder uses an Eclipse path variable named +M2_REPO+ which should point to your Maven local repository (usually +{user.home}/.m2/repository+).
It can be set in the main menu _Workspace > Preferences_, then _General > Workspace > Linked Resources_.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{client}" == "air"]
NOTE: Using Flash Builder is recommended if you want to import the Flex module in Eclipse.

NOTE: The compilation in Flash Builder uses an Eclipse path variable named +M2_REPO+ which should point to your Maven local repository (usually +{user.home}/.m2/repository+).
It can be set in the main menu _Workspace -> Preferences_, then _General > Workspace > Linked Resources_.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{client}" == "javafx"]
NOTE: The compilation of the JavaFX project in Eclipse requires adding the +jfxrt.jar+ library to the classpath. The provided project expects a 
variable named +JFX_LIB+ which should point to this library and which can be set in the main menu _Workspace > Preferences_, then _Java > Build Path > Variables_.
endif::[]

To start the server, open a new console in the folder +server-{server}+ and start one of the available Maven
embedded server configurations:

[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
cd server-{server}
----

ifeval::["{server}" == "spring"]
.Tomcat 7
----
mvn tomcat7:run-war
----
endif::[]

.JBoss AS 7.1
----
mvn jboss-as:run
----

.GlassFish 3.1.2.2
----
mvn embedded-glassfish:run
----

.Apache TomEE 1.5
----
mvn tomee:run
----

ifeval::["{client}" == "java"]
To launch the client, open a new console in the +client-java+ folder and launch the application jar file:

----
cd client-java

java -jar target/helloworld.jar John
----

This client is not interactive and simply uses the command line argument (here +John+) as argument to the remote call.
You should see some logs and the following output:
----
-----------------------------
Hello John
-----------------------------
----
endif::[]

ifeval::["{client}" == "javafx"]
Before launching the JavaFX client, it is first necessary to build a proper executable jar with the Zenjava JavaFX plugin:

----
cd client-javafx

mvn jfx:jar

java -jar target/jfx/app/helloworld.jar
----
endif::[]

ifeval::["{client}" == "flex"]
To run the Flex client, browse http://localhost:8080/helloworld/helloworld.swf[^]
endif::[]

ifeval::["{client}" == "air"]
Install and run the +.air+ package built in +client-air/target/helloworld.air+.
endif::[]

NOTE: To run the tutorial for another combination of client and server technologies, redo everything from the start
with the corresponding +client+ and +server+ arguments, so you get the correct tutorial document.


Now let's have a look at the various interesting code and configuration elements of the server and the client
applications.
